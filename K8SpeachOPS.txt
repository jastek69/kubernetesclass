🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 1 (Laptop Fallacy)

Primary question:

“If docker pull works on your laptop but fails in Kubernetes, what would you check next?”

Strong answer should include:
node identity vs local identity
registry permissions for nodes
kubectl describe pod
EKS IAM role / GKE node service account

Red flag answer:
“I’d rebuild the image or reapply the YAML.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 2 (Who Pulls the Image)

Primary question:
“What component actually performs the image pull, and how does Kubernetes instruct it to do so?”

Strong answer:
kubelet on the node
container runtime (containerd / Docker)
API server only stores desired state

Red flag answer:
“Kubernetes pulls it automatically.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 3 (YAML Addiction)

Primary question:
“Why does changing YAML often fail to fix ImagePullBackOff?”

Strong answer:
permissions live outside Kubernetes
registry auth is external
YAML can’t fix IAM

Bonus signal:
Mentions that imagePullPolicy rarely fixes auth issues.

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 4 (kubectl apply Myth)

Primary question:
“What happens between kubectl apply and the container actually starting?”

Strong answer:
API server stores object
controller reconciles desired state
scheduler assigns node
kubelet pulls image
container runtime starts container

Red flag answer:
“kubectl starts the container.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 5 (Node Identity Blind Spot)

Primary question:
“How would you verify which IAM role or service account your node is using?”

Strong answer (EKS):
inspect node IAM role
understand node group configuration
Strong answer (GKE):
inspect node pool service account
gcloud container clusters describe

Red flag:
“I’d check the Deployment.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 6 (imagePullSecret Overuse)

Primary question:
“Why is node-based identity often preferred over imagePullSecrets?”

Strong answer:
no secret rotation burden
fewer leaked credentials
centralized control
scales better

Extra credit:
Mentions blast radius trade-offs.

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 7 (Image Exists… or Not)

Primary question:
“How would you determine whether an ImagePullBackOff is caused by a missing tag vs missing permissions?”

Strong answer:
error message inspection (manifest unknown vs unauthorized)
attempt pull with known-good identity
registry UI/CLI verification

Red flag:
“I’d try another tag randomly.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 8 (Retry Misinterpretation)

Primary question:
“Why does Kubernetes retry image pulls even when the error is permanent?”

Strong answer:
Kubernetes can’t classify registry errors
assumes transient network failures
exponential backoff behavior

Bonus:
Mentions that retries don’t imply Kubernetes optimism.

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 9 (kubectl describe Discipline)

Primary question:
“Why is kubectl describe pod more useful than logs for ImagePullBackOff?”

Strong answer:
container never started
logs don’t exist yet
describe includes kubelet + registry errors

Red flag:
“I always check logs first.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 10 (Public vs Private)

Primary question:
“What changes operationally when you move from public to private registries?”

Strong answer:
authentication required
permissions must exist before scheduling
failure becomes non-obvious
introduces IAM or secrets complexity

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 11 (Cluster Nuke)

Primary question:
“Why does recreating the cluster sometimes ‘fix’ ImagePullBackOff?”

Strong answer:
new nodes get fresh IAM bindings
hides underlying permission issue
not a real fix

Red flag:
“It clears Kubernetes cache.”

🔥 Follow-up to Trick Question 12 (One-Sentence Truth)

Primary question:
“Explain image pulling in Kubernetes in one sentence.”
Strong answer (any equivalent):
“Nodes pull images using an identity; Kubernetes only tells them what to pull.”

Weak answer:
“Kubernetes downloads containers.”

Meta-Interview Question (Very Powerful)

Ask this at the end:
“If you see ImagePullBackOff, what is the first thing you check—and what is the last thing you touch?”

Strong answer:
First: kubectl describe pod
Last: YAML

That answer alone tells you whether the candidate is ready for production.
