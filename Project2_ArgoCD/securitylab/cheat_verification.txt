“Cheat Attempt” (Argo Project should deny even before Gatekeeper)

Example: try to point prod app at dev namespace while staying in prod project:

spec:
  project: splunk-prod
  destination:
    namespace: splunk-dev

  
When applied, Argo should reject it because splunk-dev is not in the allowed destinations for splunk-prod.
