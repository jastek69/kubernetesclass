Argo CD RBAC is usually configured via the argocd-rbac-cm ConfigMap in the argocd namespace using a Casbin policy.

Below is a solid template you can use immediately.

1) Decide your identity source (quick)

Argo RBAC assigns permissions to users/groups that come from:
SSO (OIDC/SAML) groups (best)
or local Argo users (OK for labs)

For class labs, you can start with simple group names like:
students
admins

Even if you don’t wire SSO yet, this teaches the RBAC mechanics.


2) Create/Update argocd-rbac-cm
argocd-rbac-cm.yaml

kubectl apply -f argocd-rbac-cm.yaml

kubectl -n argocd rollout restart deployment argocd-server

kubectl -n argocd get cm argocd-rbac-cm -o yaml | sed -n '1,200p'
